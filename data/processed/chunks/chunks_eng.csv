--- Page 2 ---

Communities across the country are on high alert. You
may hear about ICE sightings or arrests, but it may not
be clear whether it was actually ICE.

This is by design. ICE intentionally uses tactics (like not
identifying themselves or wearing clothes that look like
local police) so that it may not be clear whether they
are part of ICE.

lf you witness ICE activity, try to"
eng_002_chunk_2,eng_002,"document the

following details so communities can better determine
whether it was actually ICE, and if so, to understand



--- Page 3 ---

WHO IS THE SOURCE?

Figuring out where the information is coming from can help
you determine the reliability of what you’ve heard.
Did your source witness what happened?

W® If not, did they hear it from someone who did?

w [f not, who is the actual information about the sighting/arrest

coming from?

If they aren't a witness, do they know anyone who would"
eng_002_chunk_3,eng_002,"have more information or know the family of the person
impacted?

W® Have they spoken with the witness directly?
Ww Did the witness take photographs or video of what they saw?

Ww Has the incident been reported to a local immigrant rights
organization or local elected officials?

WHAT HAPPENED?

Crucial facts to have to verify the information.

hospital, outdoor, etc.)

How many officers were present?

w Number of officers
e Where were they? (For example: 2-3 officers entered the house
while 5-6 waited on the street)


--- Page 5 ---

WHAT IF IT ISN'T CLEAR
THAT IT WAS ICE?

Even when you get all the details, it may not always be clear
whether it was ICE.

What can you do?

™® Contact your local elected officials’ office with the details
collected.

w® Reach out to your local immigrant righ"
eng_002_chunk_5,eng_002,"ts group or community
organizers with the details collected.

groups, and/or local elected officials to share the reports.

Alth"
eng_002_chunk_6,eng_002,"ough it may seem like ICE, it's possible that it wasn't actually ICE

idea of the trends of local ICE practices - They may be able to
confirm whether it was ICE or not.

DOCUMENTING
ICE ACTIVITY:
WHAT TO TRACK



--- Page 2 ---

Communities across the country are on high alert. You
may hear about ICE sightings or arrests, but it may not
be clear whether it was actually ICE.

This is by design. ICE intentionally uses tactics (like not
identifying themselves or wearing clothes that look like
local police) so that it may not be clear whether they
are part of ICE.

ICE TELLS LIES.
DON’T FALL FOR
THEM.

Common lies or tricks ICE agents use to
enter a home or get information about

someone.

ICE’S MOST COMMON LIE IS
PRETENDING TO BE LOCAL
POLICE

So you think you are helping police
instead of helping ICE.

ICE tries to lure people outside their
home or create a fake reason to enter

their home so they can arrest the person
they have targeted.
