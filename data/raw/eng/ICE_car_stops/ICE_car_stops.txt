It’s important to pull over!

In New York, if you are the driver, you must pull
over if stopped by any law enforcement officer,
even if you don’t think you did anything wrong.

do not stop, the ICE officers might use force or
violence to stop your car.

DO | HAVE TO GIVE ICE
MY FINGERPRINTS?

ICE officers can only take your fingerprints
if they reasonably suspect you violated an
immigration law or if they arrest you.

lf the officers do not know who you are or you
suspect they are asking for your fingerprints based
on the way you look, say:

e “Why am I being fingerprinted?”
e “T don’t consent to being fingerprinted.”

Be safe: Don’t resist if ICE still forces you to take
fingerprints. Tell the officers you don’t consent -
it might help you in an immigration case.
