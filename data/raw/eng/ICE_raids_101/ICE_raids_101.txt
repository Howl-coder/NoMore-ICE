ANYONE CAN DOCUMENT
AN ICE RAID

Even if you dont know the people
involved, raids can be documented by:
e Taking photos or videos

e Taking notes immediately after
witnessing an encounter

e Saving communications from ICE agents
(i.e. texts or voicemails)

e Interviewing other witnesses and
writing down what they've seen

e Reviewing security camera footage

e Even if an ICE agents tells you to stop
recording, you can continue to do so as
long as you do not interfere with the
arrest and do not do it in secret.

e While there are only a few instances
where ICE agents can take your phone,
be aware that they may do so regardless
of whether it is legal

If you or a loved one could be at risk of an ICE arrest,
speak to an attorney for individualized advice.

REMEMBER

e Assess the situation before you film. If
you are concerned about your safety, or
the safety of the person interacting with
ICE, there are other ways to document
an arrest.

e Share what you documented with any
family or families of the individual
arrested. Before posting on social media,
reach out to local organizations that
track ICE raids.

If you or a loved one could be at risk of an ICE arrest,
speak to an attorney for individualized advice.
