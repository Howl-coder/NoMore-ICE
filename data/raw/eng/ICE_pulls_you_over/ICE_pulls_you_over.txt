It is legal to film ICE regardless of your immigration
status.

Make sure to film openly - some states have laws
prohibiting secret recordings.

Physically interfering or not complying with a direction
to back up can put you in danger and risk your arrest.

Even if an ICE agents tells you to stop recording, you can
continue to do so as long as you do not interfere with the
arrest.

While there are only a few instances where ICE agents
can take your phone, be aware that they may do so
regardless of whether it is legal.
