states have laws prohibiting secret
recordings.

the arrest or interaction.

doing so may result in your arrest.

REMINDER

e Even if an ICE agents tells you to
stop recording, you can continue
to do soas long as you do not
interfere with the arrest.

¢ While there are only a few
instances where ICE agents can
take your phone, be aware that
they may do so regardless of
whether it is legal.

REMINDER

e Assess the situation before you
film. If you are concerned about
your Safety, or the safety of the
person interacting with ICE, there
are other ways to document an
arrest.

Share what you documented with
any family or families of the
individual arrested. Before posting
on social media, reach out to local
organizations that track ICE raids.
