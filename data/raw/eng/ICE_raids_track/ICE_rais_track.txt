DOCUMENTING
ICE ACTIVITY:
WHAT TO TRACK



--- Page 2 ---

Communities across the country are on high alert. You
may hear about ICE sightings or arrests, but it may not
be clear whether it was actually ICE.

This is by design. ICE intentionally uses tactics (like not
identifying themselves or wearing clothes that look like
local police) so that it may not be clear whether they
are part of ICE.

ANYONE CAN DOCUMENT
ICE ACTIVITY

Even if you dont know the people involved, raids
can be documented by:

e

Taking photos or videos
Taking notes immediately after witnessing an encounter

Saving communications from ICE agents
(i.e. texts or voicemails)

Interviewing other witnesses and writing down
what they've seen

Reviewing security camera footage

WHAT IF IT ISN'T CLEAR
THAT IT WAS ICE?

Even with these details, it may not always be clear.

What can you do?

@ Reach out first to family members of the person arrested to share
what you saw. Let them decide if they want to share what
happened publicly.

@ = Contact your local elected officials’ office with the details
collected.

a = Contact your local immigrant rights group or community organizers
with the details collected.

Why? They may be able to determine whether the tactics
described are consistent with ICE practices on the ground, and/or
have ideas of other agencies you can reach out to for more

information.

THINKING ABOUT SHARING
WHAT YOU SAW OR HEARD
ON SOCIAL MEDIA?

SHARE RESPONSIBLY!
Reach out to local organizers, mutual aid groups, immigrant
rights groups, and/or local elected officials.

Although it may seem like ICE, it's possible that it wasn't
actually ICE and sharing or resharing the inaccurate
information can cause more fear.

IF YOU DECIDE TO SHARE
ON SOCIAL MEDIA

Take all the steps possible to verify the information
before putting it out in public

Don't use the names or identifying information of the
person arrested.

If you have photos or videos, blur the faces of anyone in
the images. You don’t accidentally want to share the
information about the person arrested on the internet.

REMINDERS

KE

It is legal to film ICE regardless of your immigration
status.

Make sure to film openly - some states have laws
prohibiting secret recordings.

Physically interfering or not complying with a direction
to back up can put you in danger and risk your arrest.

Even if an ICE agents tells you to stop recording, you can
continue to do so as long as you do not interfere with the
arrest.

While there are only a few instances where ICE agents
can take your phone, be aware that they may do so
regardless of whether it is legal.
